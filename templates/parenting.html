        <h1>Parenting</h1>
        <p>The experience of parenting is often filled with wonder, warmth and joy. There is nothing quite as amazing as seeing your child develop and grow, coming to you to share their triumphs and defeats. However, for many parents the dream of parenting is quite different from reality. Your child may be so different from you that it’s hard to create a deep connection. You may be experiencing postpartum depression and getting through the day is a challenge. You may have recently learned that your child has a developmental disability and are having a hard time coming to terms with what this means for your life and theirs. Or your child may recently have come out as LGBTQIA+ and you’re having a hard time reconciling your own feelings about their identity. Parenting comes with huge highs and lows. Therapy is a safe,  non-judgmental  place to explore your feelings, to learn more about your own hopes and assumptions about what parenting would be like, as well as how your own experience of being parented affects your parenting style.</p>
